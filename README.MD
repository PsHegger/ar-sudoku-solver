# ML Kit Sudoku Solver

This project is a proof of concept using [Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit), [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) and some maths to create an AR Sudoku Solver.

The application is not ready for anything serious as it has a lot of problems, but it does the job.
Please be sure to only have the Sudoku in the viewfinder as the application sometimes picks up other numbers which can lead to the app freezing.
